# Open-source FPS template by Elympics

This repository is a *free* FPS template for Unity game developers that want to build their first multiplayer shooter. We designed it as a sample browser game to give you a real feel of its possibilities, but you can also access its source code here.
You can use it as a basis for your own shooter or any other multiplayer game for 2-4 players: the mechanics it features are universal and may be re-used for other genres. You can find their complete list in the next section.

This template is meant to be a learning resource for the new users of Elympics, our standard industry framework for blockchain-integrated multiplayer games. It’ll help you understand how it works and show you the good practices related to it. You can easily integrate it with blockchain using our Web3 Kit – contact us at hello@elympics.cc for more details.
